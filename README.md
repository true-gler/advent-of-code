# Advent-of-Code

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 

I provide a folder for each year I participate.

Each day is structured in a subfolder that contains:

- Description of the task (readMe.md file)
- Input for the task
- Solution that solves the task ("Program.cs")

## Specfication
Solutions are done in .NET 5.
