# Advent-of-Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 
I provide a folder for each year I participate.

Each day is structured in a subfolder that contains:

- Description of the task (readMe.md file)
- Input for the task
- Solution that solves the task ("Program.cs")

## Specfication
Solutions are done in .NET 5.
